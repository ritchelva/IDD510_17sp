  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


      <h4>Are you a cafe?  Can I come by and get a cup of coffee?</h4>

      <h3>We are a coffee roastery as opposed to a coffee shop or a cafe.  Most of our time is spent researching coffee, experimenting with coffee&#44; and roasting coffee.  If you live in or are visiting our city&#44; you are welcome to come by and pick up a bag (or ten) of coffee.  We may even have something brewed up for you to sample!</h3>


      <h4>Do you sell flavored coffees?</h4>
      <h3>This question usually refers to coffee beans that have been covered with artificially flavored oils.  It would hurt our hearts too deeply to cover up the magnificent naturally-occuring flavors in the coffees we roast.  And we say that in the least coffee-snobbish way we know how.</h3>


      <h4>Why is your coffee more expensive than what I can buy at the grocery store?</h4>
      <h3>One word: Quality.  Corners are cut in both the cultivation and roasting of cheap coffees which allows for those low prices.  Many consumers do not mind that&#44; which is fair enough.  Two areas we really ought to consider&#44; however&#44; are the environmental sustainability of cutting corners in cultivation and the distinct possibility that the farmers may not be paid a &#39;fair trade&#39; wage.   Okay, one more word: Value.  In other words you get what you pay for.  If you&#39;d like us to elaborate on that, give us a shout and we&#39;ll talk your ears off about it.<br>
      I have a Keurig machine, and I love it. </h3> 

      <h4>For how long will my coffee be fresh? 
      <h3>For peak freshness&#44; enjoy your Ironclad coffee within two weeks of the roast date.  Failing that&#44; it&#39;s best to exceed no more than four weeks.  Please remember to grind your coffee right before brewing if at all possible.

      <h4>Is it a good idea to store my coffee in the refrigerator or freezer? 
      <h3>Nope.  The problem here lies in the fact that condensation will inevitably build up whenever you remove the coffee from these cold environments to room temperature.  That spells trouble for your coffee.  We suggest buying only the quantity of coffee you will drink over a two or three-week period and storing it in a dark cabinet in your kitchen.

      <h4>Will you grind my coffee for me? 
      <h3>We always recommend acquiring a decent burr grinder to grind your own coffee just prior to brewing it&#44; but we will grind your coffee orders for you if needed.  Simply select the brewing method you&#39;ll be using while adding your coffees to your cart&#44; and we&#39;ll grind it to the appropriate level.
       
      Do you have a question not answered here?  Send it along&#44; and we&#39;ll give you an answer.
